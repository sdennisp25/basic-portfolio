			<p>
			My name is Sipha Phaophongsavath, Dennis for short! I am the second youngest out of five kids. I was born and raised in Kearns Utah. Graduated from the University of Utah with my Bachelors in Physics. I am currently employed at a finance firm and have been there for almost nine months now.
			</p>
			<p>
			On my free time I like to break dance, go hiking, workout, work on my car, and hang out with my puppy named Harper. I was highly involved in high school and transitioning into the University. I teach break dancing during the season, I played rugby, a part of the ball room dance team, and was activily a part of a leadership organization at the U. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I currently am an alumni for my leadership organization and perform with a dance company called Junction. I like to stay involved and participate in extracurricular activities. I listen to a lot of old school rap and hip hop such as NWA, Notorious BIG, Eazy-E, Erik B and Rakim etc.
