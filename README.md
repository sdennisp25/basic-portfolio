1) I began creating the first page of the assignment called the About me page. It was a very difficult task at first, as I was very new to the html/css coding. At first, I was very confused on creating the framework of the code. I've overcame all of this by analyzing a lot of other peoples code online and my peers to gain a more clear understanding of the layout and re-enforced context.
